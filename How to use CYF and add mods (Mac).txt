HOW TO RUN CYF ON MAC
=====================

1: Open a command prompt in the folder containing CYF's application file.
2: Run the command
	   sudo chmod +x "<application file>"
   "<application file>" is the name of the CYF app in the CreateYourFrisk folder.
   Here's an example of a potentially valid full command: sudo chmod +x "CreateYourFrisk-macos64.app", if the CYF app is named "CreateYourFrisk-macos64.app".
   If the command does not work because of administrator right issues, remove the "sudo" word and try again.
3: Run the command
	   sudo chmod +x "<application file>/Contents/MacOS/<internal file>"
   "<application file>" is the name of the CYF app in the CreateYourFrisk folder.
   "<internal file>" is the name of the executable nested within the application file.
   To access it, right click on CYF's aplication file and click the option "Show Package Contents".
   Once you do, navigate to the folder "Contents/MacOS", the file in that folder is the one you want to copy the name of and replace that part with in the path above.
   Here's an example of a potentially valid full command: sudo chmod +x "CreateYourFrisk-macos64.app/Contents/MacOS/CreateYourFrisk-macos64", if the CYF app is named "CreateYourFrisk-macos64.app" and its internal executable is named "CreateYourFrisk-macos64".
   If the command does not work because of administrator right issues, remove the "sudo" word and try again.
4: Now the app should be able to run!
