            <h2>Welcome to Create Your Frisk's documentation!</h2><br><br>
            
            <p><span style="color:#aa0000">NOTE:</span> There will be casual <span style="color:#aa0000">spoilers</span>
                all over the place. If you haven't played or completed Undertale yet, it's highly recommended that you do
                so first! Don't say you weren't warned.
				<br><br>
                You probably want to get right in, so let's keep it short. Honestly, the fastest way to get started is
                to check out the existing encounters and tinker with them. The documentation is for reference if you
                want to know the specifics of everything. Help is provided on the 
                <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Unitale">/r/Unitale subreddit</a>.
                <br><br>
				<span style="color:#aa0000"><u>FOR CYF COMPATIBILITY:</u></span> You have to add these two lines in the <span class="term">EncounterStarting()
				</span> function:
				<div class="code-container">
				<pre class="brush: lua;">
				Inventory.AddCustomItems({"Dogtest1", "Dogtest2", "Dogtest3", "Dogtest4", "Dogtest5", "Dogtest6", "Dogtest7"}, {3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3})
				Inventory.SetInventory({"Dogtest1", "Dogtest2", "Dogtest3", "Dogtest4", "Dogtest5", "Dogtest6", "Dogtest7"})
				</pre>
				</div>
				<br>Of course, if your encounter already uses an item system, you have to replace the names and the effects.
				<br>0 for consumable, 1 for weapon, 2 for armor and 3 for special
				<br><br>
				<span style="color:#aa0000"><u>FOR BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY:</u></span> You can use the retromode in the modDev mode.
                It's not perfect, but it's better than nothing, I guess.
				<br><br>
                <i><u>Basic setup</u></i><br>
                Details folder structure of mods, how the game reads folders and expects files, that kind of stuff.
                Recommended to start with.<br>
                <br>
                <i><u>Terminology</u></i><br>
                This is a short page on how what things are called in the documentation. For instance, the white box
                that the bullet dodging occurs in is referred to as the &quot;arena&quot;. Recommended read so you don't
                get lost in later parts of the documentation.<br>
                <br>
                <i><u>API - Text commands</u></i><br>
                This is where all the special commands are that you can use in your dialogue boxes. Text effects,
                colours, character voices, automatic skipping, you name it. You can even add commands to run Lua
                code!<br>
                <br>
                <i><u>API - Game events</u></i><br>
                If you want to get your hands dirty with Lua, these are the functions the game will use from your
                script, and at what point they're used. Useful for if you want to have certain events occur during
                specific times, such as before/after using an act command or item, or just before the fight starts. A
                must-read for interactive fights.<br>
                <br>
                <i><u>API - Functions &amp; Objects</u></i><br>
                These are most custom functions and objects that you can use in your scripts, detailing how to use them
                and what they do. Want to control the music, check for game events or handle keyboard input? Global
                variables so you can communicate between scripts? Need to know how much HP the player has, damage them,
                heal them? This is where to go! Projectile management and sprite management are split off into separate
                sections below.<br>
                <br>
                <i><u>API - Projectile management</u></i><br>
                This is where you can read details about how to create projectiles, what you can do with them and some
                short examples.<br>
                <br>
                <i><u>API - Sprites &amp; Animation</u></i><br>
                This section is about creating sprites and how to control them. By combining the sprite functions, you
                can create animations.<br>
                <br>
                <i><u><span class="CYF"></span> API - Key List</u></i><br>
                This section shows you the list of keys available for <span class="term">Input.GetKey(key)</span> and <span class="term">[waitfor:key]</span>.
				<br>
                <br>
                <i><u><span class="CYF"></span> Added features</u></i><br>
                Pretty exhaustive list of things that I added in CYF. However, you know me: some things may be forgotten.<br>
                <br>
                <i><u><span class="CYF"></span> The Inventory System</u></i><br>
                This section shows you how CYF's Inventory System works. Get rid of the dogtests! <br>
                <br>
                <i><u><span class="CYF"></span> The Pixel-Perfect Collision System</u></i><br>
                This section shows you how CYF's Pixel-Perfect Collision System works. Why would you use square hitboxes when
				you have a system like this?<br>
				<br>
                <i><u><span class="CYF"></span> Overworld - Basics</u></i><br>
                Explains how CYF's Overworld broadly works.<br>
                <br>
                <i><u><span class="CYF"></span> Overworld - Functions</u></i><br>
                Shows the complete list of Overworld functions that can be used in events.<br>
                <br>
            </p>
        </div>
       
        <div class="tab-pane text-style" id="howtoreadthisdocumentation">
            <h2>How to read this documentation</h2><br><br>
            <p>After people had some problems reading the documentation correctly, I decided to create this little tutorial.</p>
            <p>Let's say you saw something in the documentation that looks like this:</p>
            <p><span class="term">
			<!-- <div class="code-container"> -->
			<!-- <pre class="brush: lua"> -->
			Screen.DispImg(string path, int ID, float posX, float posY, int toneR = 255, int toneG = 255, int toneB = 255, int toneA = 255)
			<!-- </pre> -->
			<!-- </div> -->
			</span></p>
            <p>There are several things to know here. First of all, the arguments have a type and a name. The name really is here just to help you to know 
			what the variable is,
               you don't really have to care about it. However, the type is important, it determines what kind of variable you'll need to send.<br>
               <br>In this example, "string" is a character chain (i.e. "hello"), "int" is an integer (i.e. 4) and "float" is a number (i.e. 3.6 or -2.) </p>
            <p>One last thing with functions: some of these arguments have a value after them - this is the variable's default value. So, you can
               use the function without including that argument.<br>
               In our example, that means that you can call just <span class="term">Screen.DispImg("poseur", 1, 320, 240)</span> - but you can add the 
			   other values if you want to add them.<br>
               However, if you need to set <span class="term">toneB</span> in our example, you need to set <span class="term">toneR</span> and <span class=
			   "term">toneG</span> before it, as well. If you want to keep the default values, just enter these :P<br>
               <br>So if we want to fully call this function and set <span class="term">toneA</span> to 255, we have to call it like this: <br><div class=
			   "code-container"><pre class="brush: lua">Screen.DispImg("poseur", 1, 320, 240, 255, 255, 255, 255)</pre></div></p>
            <p>Finally, if you're a fan of Unitale and want to use it instead of CYF, but still want to use this documentation, note this: all the variables 
			or functions with this tag: <span class="CYF"></span> are only usable in CYF.</p>
            <p>Now that you know how to read the documentation, you should keep reading! It'd be too bad if you stopped now :P</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-pane text-style" id="controls">
            <h2>Controls</h2><br><br>
            <p><span class="term">Arrow keys, Z (or Enter), X (or left/right Shift)</span> - The same as in Undertale.
            </p>
            <p><span class="term">Esc</span> - Resets to the Mod Selection screen to assist in quickly testing mods.
                Will not work on the disclaimer screen. <span class="CYF"></span>: disabled if the encounter has "<span class="term">unescape</span>" set 
				to true</p>
            <p><span class="term">F9</span> - Toggles the debug console. You can write text to this with
                <span class="term">DEBUG("your text here")</span> in your scripts.</p>
            <p><span class="term">Alt+Enter</span> - Fullscreens the game. <span class="term">F4</span> works too, but not on the disclaimer/Game
                Over screens.</p>
			<p><span class="CYF"></span> <span class="term">H</span> - In a battle, this shows the hitboxes of the bullets and the player.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-pane text-style" id="basic">
            <h2>Basic setup</h2><br><br>
            <p>IMPORTANT NOTE: Due to the hasty implementation of file loading, your encounter will currently break if
                certain folders are missing. To make sure this doesn't happen, please preserve the folder structure of
                the example mods, <i>even if you have no files in a certain folder.</i> It's an early alpha and we're
                working on it!</p>

            <p>By this point you'll probably want to set up an encounter of your own. Right now, we only have encounters
                implemented, and even that's still a work in progress! Currently, scripts are set up like this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Monster scripts - will contain information about your enemies. Here, you'll set things like their
                    ATK, DEF, HP, random comments that might show up as encounter texts, random dialogue, and what ACT
                    commands they have.
                </li><br>
                <li>Encounter scripts - will contain a set of monsters, a set of wave scripts (that you can modify at
                    any point), size of the arena, custom interactions for items, etc. <br>
                    A lot of Unitale's functions will be run on the Encounter scripts first. If there's no custom
                    behaviour on the encounter, many of these functions will then also be run on the Monster scripts.
                    More information on this can be found in the <span class="ref">API - Game events</span> section.
                </li><br>
                <li>Wave scripts - will contain an update function. You may use these to spawn, track, modify and
                    otherwise interact with bullets during the defending phase of the game.
                </li><br>
            </ul>
            <p>Eventually, you will be able to call up your encounter scripts from various places in the overworld.
                The current version of the game lets you select which encounter you
                want to play.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Files and directories</h3><br><br>
            <p>It's fairly self-explanatory. If you just want to move on fast, feel free to skip this section and go to
                the next one. If for any reason some of your files don't work, you might want to read this anyway.</p>
            <h4>Scripts</h4>
            <p>The <i>Encounter scripts</i> are located in <span class="term"><i>YOUR MOD/Lua/Encounters/</i></span>. The <i>Monster scripts</i>
                are in <span class="term"><i>YOUR MOD/Lua/Monsters/</i></span>, and your wave scripts at <span class="term"><i>YOUR MOD/Lua/Waves/</i></span>. If you're
                getting started, check out these files in example encounters to see how they're put together. Starting
                from 0.2, there's also an optional <span class="term"><i>YOUR MOD/Lua/Libraries/</i></span> folder. You can put libraries other
                people have made in here (or create your own) for use in your other scripts. Libraries/modules are more
                Lua functionality than they are Unitale functionality, so please read up about them <a
                        href="http://lua-users.org/wiki/ModulesTutorial">here</a> instead. There is an example encounter
                included making use of one such library. Plus, the overworld permits you to have <i>Event scripts</i>
                located in <span class="term"><i>YOURMOD/Lua/Events/</i></span> if you want to use the overworld.</p>
            <h4>Music</h4>
            <p>Music can be put in <span class="term"><i>YOUR MOD/Audio/</i></span>. Your music must be in .ogg or .wav format. <a
                    href="http://audacityteam.org/download/">Audacity</a> can export to .ogg if you're missing the
                appropriate software.</p>
            <h4>Sounds</h4>
            <p>Sounds can be put in <span class="term"><i>YOUR MOD/Sounds/</i></span>. They must be in .ogg or .wav format. You can play them with
                <span class="term">Audio.PlaySound(filename)</span>; more on this in <span class="ref">API - Functions &amp; Objects</span>.</p>
            <h4>Voices</h4>
            <p>Voices can be put in <span class="term"><i>YOUR MOD/Voices/</i></span>. They must be in .ogg or .wav format, although .wav is
                generally recommended. You can use them with the <span class="term">[voice]</span> text command; more on this in <span class="ref">API - Text
                    commands</span>.</p>
            <h4>Sprites</h4>
            <p>Sprites can be put in <span class="term"><i>YOUR MOD/Sprites/</i></span>. They must be in the .png format. Note that most vanilla
                Undertale monster sprites start with a small base resolution, then resize the sprite to 2x its original
                resolution for an oldschool look. To <i>add a background</i> you can have one file titled <span class="term">bg.png</span>
                in the sprites folder. This image will stretch over the entire background, so 640x480 resolution is
                recommended. This is <i>not</i> the final solution for backgrounds; it just beats not having one.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>The Default directory</h3><br><br>
            <p>Starting from 0.2 Unitale now has a default directory. This is where resources from Undertale reside. It
                is not advised to modify files in this directory, as they are expected to be the same across all
                installations. <br><br>If you wish to replace any of the files for your mod, create a file with the same
                name at the same location instead. For instance, if you want to change the player soul hurt sound, don't
                replace <span class="term">Default/Sounds/hurtsound.wav</span>. Instead, create a new file located at <span class="term"><i>YOUR
                    MOD/Sounds/hurtsound.wav</i></span>.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Basic variables and their usage</h3><br><br>
            <p>Now that all of that's out of the way, it's time to set up the basics of an encounter! The fastest way to
                get started is to copy the 'Encounter Skeleton' mod and play with the values in it, then either copying
                over existing examples' code, or writing your own. This section serves to explain the variables you
                see.</p>

            <p><span class="term">music</span> - Name of your encounter's starting music, without the file extension. If this variable isn't
                present, it'll play Undertale's default battle theme. If you don't want any music, call
                <span class="term">Audio.Stop()</span> in the <span class="term">EncounterStarting()</span> function. For more information see <span class="ref">API - Game
                    events</span>.</p>
            <p><span class="term">encountertext</span> - Set the initial text of your encounter here. After that, you can modify it at any time in
                preparation for the next turn. <span class="term">encountertext</span> gets read out at the start of every new turn (i.e.
                you going back to the FIGHT/ACT/ITEM/MERCY selection).</p>
            <p><span class="term">nextwaves</span> - A list of all simultaneous attack waves you want when the monsters start their attacks. You
                can modify this at any time, and it'll get read out before the enemies start their attack. For most
                boss-type encounters, you'll likely only want one wave simultaneously - but you can get creative
                here.</p>
            <p><span class="term">wavetimer</span> - How long it takes for the defending step to end. If this isn't set anywhere, it'll be the
                default <i>4.0 seconds</i>.</p>
            <p><span class="term">arenasize</span> - The inner size of the box the player's constrained to. <span class="term">{155, 130}</span> is the default size for a
                lot of basic Undertale encounters. Papyrus' battle, for instance, has this at <span class="term">{245, 130}</span> most of the
                time. You may modify this at any time - it'll only get read out before the enemies start their
                attack.<br>
                Note: lowest possible setting is <span class="term">{16, 16}</span> - this is the size of the player's soul. Anything lower will
                be set to 16 anyway.</p>
            <p><span class="term">enemies</span> - Defines the names of your enemy scripts that will be used in your encounter. In this example.
                <span class="term">vegetoid.lua</span> will be used from the Monsters folder. After initialization, the names will be
                replaced by Script controller objects you can use to control your monster scripts. Refer to <span class="ref">API -
                    Functions &amp; Objects</span> for more information.</p>
            <p><span class="term">enemypositions</span> - Defines where the enemies are on the screen. <span class="term">{0, 0}</span> means they're centered just above the arena, with 1 pixel of space inbetween. <span class="term">{-30, 0}</span> means above the arena to the left; <span class="term">{50, 80}</span> means 50 pixels to the right and 80 pixels above that center.<br>
                You will always need at least as many enemy positions as enemies in your encounter. In this example we
                have 3 enemy positions set to show you how you can define more than one, but since this example only
                contains Vegetoid you only really need one position.</p>
			<p><span class="CYF"></span> <span class="term">autolinebreak</span> - False by default. If this value is set to
                true, the auto linebreak system will automatically add line breaks (<span class="term">\r</span>) to the text. No need to use <span class="term">\r</span> or <span class="term">\n</span> anymore!</p>
			<p><span class="CYF"></span> <span class="term">playerskipdocommand</span> - False by default. If this value is
                set to true, the text commands will be launched even if the player skips the text-  except for <span class="term">[w]</span> and
                <span class="term">[letters]</span> commands and commands with the tag "<span class="term">skipover</span>".</p>
			<p><span class="CYF"></span> <span class="term">unescape</span> - False by default. If this value is set to true, you can't exit the battle with the ESC
				key anymore.</p>
			<p><span class="CYF"></span> <span class="term">flee</span> - True by default. If this value is set to false, the flee option will not be selectable anymore.</p>
			<p><span class="CYF"></span> <span class="term">revive</span> - If this variable is set to true, the player will be revived when they hit 0 HP.</p>
			<p><span class="CYF"></span> <span class="term">deathtext</span> - Text displayed when the player dies, in the Game Over screen. By default, it'll use the normal death text.<br>
			Is used as the revive text too. By default, there will be no revive text.</p>
			<p><span class="CYF"></span> <span class="term">deathmusic</span> - Sets the death music. The music is launched if <span class="term">revive</span> is not set.</p>
			<p><span class="CYF"></span> <span class="term">Wave</span> - A table returning the current wave scripts used. Returns a table with a length of 0 if not in the state DEFENDING.</p>

            </div>
            <p><span class="term">comments</span> - A list of random comments attached to this monster. You can retrieve one at random using the
                <span class="term">RandomEncounterText()</span> function in your Encounter script. See <span class="ref">API - Functions &amp; Objects</span> for
                details.</p>
            <p><span class="term">commands</span> - A list of ACT commands you can do. Listed in the ACT menu and used in <span class="term">HandleCustomCommand()</span>.
                See <span class="ref">API - Game events</span> for details. Note that the behaviour for Check is built-in, and shows you
                the monster's <span class="term">name</span> followed by the <span class="term">ATK</span> and <span class="term">DEF</span>, and then the <span class="term">check</span> variable
                you'll see all the way down.</p>
            <p><span class="term">randomdialogue</span> - A list of random dialogue the monster can have. One of these is selected at random if
                <span class="term">currentdialogue</span> is <span class="term">nil</span> (i.e. has no value).</p>
            <p><span class="term">currentdialogue</span> - The next dialogue for this monster. This overrides the random dialogue and is meant for
                special actions (e.g. you hit Vegetoid's green carrots after selecting Dinner from the ACT menu). This
                variable gets <i>cleared every time after it's read out in the monster dialogue phase</i>. This is done
                so you don't have to take care of managing it manually.</p>
            <p><span class="term">cancheck</span> - Either true or false. You can leave this line out; it will be true by default. If set to
                false, it will disable the default Check action that shows up in your ACT menu. If you want a custom
                Check action, you can add it back into your <span class="term">commands</span> table, and handle it like any other custom
                command. See <span class="ref">API - Game events</span> for details.</p>
            <p><span class="term">canspare</span> - Either true or false. If you leave this line out, it'll be set to false by default. If you
                change this to true, your monster's name will turn yellow and it will be spareable.</p>
            <br>
            <p><span class="term">sprite</span> - Name of the sprite in your Sprites folder, without the .PNG extension. This is the initial
                sprite for your monster. It can be changed using <span class="term">SetSprite(name)</span>; see <span class="ref">API - Functions &amp; Objects</span> for details.</p>
            <p><span class="CYF"></span> <span class="term">monstersprite</span> - Sprite handler of the monster.
            <p><span class="term">dialogbubble</span> - What dialogue bubble will be used for the monster's dialogue. You can change this at any
                time, but this <i>must</i> be initially set to something. For a list of all possible options, check the
                <a href="media/dialogoptions.png">dialog bubble names</a> chart; it's also in the sidebar.</p>
                Positioning of the bubbles is done automatically.
            <p><span class="term">name</span> - Monster name. Fairly self-explanatory; shows up in the FIGHT/ACT menus. Can also be changed at any
                time.</p>
            <p><span class="term">hp</span> - Your monster's max HP, initially. After the fight has started this value will always accurately
                reflect your monster's current HP. You can then modify this value to change your monster's current
                HP.</p>
            <p><span class="CYF"></span> <span class="term">maxhp</span> - Your monster's max HP. After the fight has started this value will be always the same, unless you
			change it. It is mainly used for lifebars and such. You better not set it as 0 or as a negative number,
			though.</p>
            <p><span class="term">atk</span> - Your monster's ATK. Only used in the default Check handler; bullet damage is set through wave
                scripts. If you're not using the default Check you can leave this out.</p>
            <p><span class="term">def</span> - Your monster's DEF.</p>
            <p><span class="term">xp</span> - Your monster's XP upon actually defeating them. You only get this by killing the monster.</p>
            <p><span class="term">gold</span> - Gold you get from either killing or sparing this monster. Since the gold can change based on
                whether you kill or spare the monster, you can modify this at any time up until the fight ends.</p>
            <p><span class="term">check</span> - When checking with the default Check option, this is what's listed under the monster's name, ATK
                and DEF.</p>
            <p><span class="CYF"></span> <span class="term">unkillable</span> - Set it to true and the monster will not be killed if it has less than 1 HP. However, it can
				still be killed with <span class="term">Kill()</span>.</p>
			<p><span class="CYF"></span> <span class="term">canmove</span> - The enemies need some initialization frames to place themselves correctly, so you can't move or unbind the
				enemy's sprite if those haven't finished. True if you can move the sprite, otherwise it's false. Actually, now that the battle's launch is delayed, this value
                is deprecated as it'll always be true.</p>
			<p><span class="CYF"></span> <span class="term">posx</span> - The x position of the center of the enemy's sprite.</p>
			<p><span class="CYF"></span> <span class="term">posy</span> - The y position of the bottom of the enemy's sprite.</p>
			<p><span class="CYF"></span> <span class="term">font</span> - The default font used by the monster. Set it to nil if you want to use the normal monster font.</p>
			<p><span class="CYF"></span> <span class="term">voice</span> - The default voice used by the monster. Set it to nil if you want to use the default voice.</p>

            <h4>Wave script variables</h4>
            <p>Wave scripts don't have any variables that are read out from the start, but you can define your own. An
                instance of a wave script is made when you start defending, and is destroyed when the defending step
                ends. As such, you can't store variables in a wave script for reusing later. Use the Encounter script to
                keep track of things.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-pane text-style" id="terms">
            <h2>Terminology</h2><br><br>
            <p><span class="term">arena</span> - The inside of the white box in which the player is allowed to move.</p>
            <p><span class="term">bullet</span> - Everything in a wave that can collide with you. Flowey's pellets would
                be referred to as bullets, but so would Papyrus' bones, anything Woshua can shoot (of any colour), even
                the dancing Migosp.</p>
            <p><span class="term">encounter text</span> - The text that shows up before you've selected FIGHT/ACT/ITEM/MERCY.</p>
            <p><span class="term">monster dialogue</span> - Text from monsters in an encounter, often seen before
                attacking. Can also be multiple dialogue boxes for special encounters.</p>
            <p><span class="term">dialog</span> - A user interface component that contains text. For example, the battle
                dialog window. The distinction between "dialog" and "dialogue" is that "dialog" refers to interface windows
                containing text, and "dialogue" refers to the speech content of monsters.</p>
            <p><span class="term">wave</span> - A single attack behaviour (or attack "wave", to say), measured from when
                you start defending until when it stops. Vegetoid's bouncing vegetables attack would count as a wave.
                Papyrus' special Cool Dude attack would also count as a wave. Unitale works with "wave scripts" for
                attacks; you can use multiple wave scripts at the same time for when you have various monsters.</p>
			<p><span class="CYF"></span> <span class="term">overworld</span> - A CYF feature that is external to battles. It allows
				the user to explore maps, like in Undertale. The overworld can contain event objects, too.<br>You can find a tutorial
				on maps in <span class="ref">How to create a map</span> and a tutorial on events is in <span class="ref">How
				to create an event</span>.
				</p>
			<p><span class="CYF"></span> <span class="term">modDev</span> - This is a feature exclusive to CYF. It's the
				same as the mod selection screen in Unitale, but with some extra debug tools. For instance, this screen lets you reset
				all <span class="term">real globals</span> and <span class="term">AlMighty globals</span>. It also allows you to
				enable or disable <span class="term">safe mode</span> and <span class="term">retrocompatibilty mode</span>.</p>
			<p><span class="CYF"></span> <span class="term">retrocompatibilty mode</span> - This CYF feature is designed in such
				a way where, if it's enabled, functions from 0.2.1a that were changed in CYF will function exactly as they did
				in 0.2.1a.</p>
			<p><span class="CYF"></span> <span class="term">safe mode</span> - This is a CYF-mode that removes swear words found
				in CYF. Mod authors can also use this to do the same in their mods, maybe even also using this to remove blood
				or mature content.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tab-pane text-style" id="api-text">
            <h2>Text commands</h2><br><br>
            <p>There are <b>two types</b> of text commands: commands that get executed <u>instantly</u>, like text color
                and effects; and commands that get executed <u>inline</u>, as they're displayed, like wait commands and
                character voices. Note that currently, if you skip a text command (with X), it'll also skip all inline
                commands that were still in your text.<span class="CYF"></span> <i>Unless</i>, that is, you use <span class="term">playerskipdocommand</span> :P</p>

            <p>On line breaks: there are actually two different kinds. In <i>UI messages</i> where asterisks are used,
                you can use <span class="term">\n</span> to start a new line <i>with</i> an asterisk. If you want a new line <i>without</i>
                an asterisk, use <span class="term">\r</span>.</p>

            <p>This is different for monster dialogue that isn't prefixed with asterisks: <i>Always</i> use <span class="term">\n</span> for line
                breaks here.<span class="CYF"></span> Or use <span class="term">autolinebreak</span>! See <span class="ref">Basic Setup</span>.</p>

                <li><span class="term">shake</span>: Shaking text. Flowey uses this sometimes. Intensity sets how far the letters offset, in

                Prevents this dialogue from being skipped by pressing X. Has no effect in encounter texts as you don't
                control that. Is effective only at the moment it's launched, so if you want a text to not be skippable at the beginning, use it as

            <h2>Game events</h2><br><br>
            <p>This section is all about game events. Game events are functions in your scripts that the Unitale engine
                runs at various points in the game. By changing up your behaviour depending on the actions the player
                takes, you can go beyond a basic encounter and make it great.</p>
            <p>There are two kinds of events. We'll refer to them as <i>inherited events</i> and <i>script-specific
                events</i>. An <i>inherited event</i> is a function that gets run first on your Encounter script. If the
                function is not found in the Encounter script, it will try to run the same function on all monsters. If
                it's not found there either, it will resort to a default, built-in handler. <i>Script-specific
                    events</i> are, as the name implies, functions that only happen for this specific script type. We'll
                start with the first type.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Inherited events (Encounter -> Monster)</h3><br><br>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function">EncounterStarting()</span>
                Happens once when everything's done initializing but before any encounter actions start. You should do
                things like stopping the music here, or using <span class="term">State()</span> if you want to start the fight off with some
                dialogue.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function">EnemyDialogueStarting()</span>
                Happens when you go to the monster dialogue state. You're still free to modify monster dialogue here.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function">EnemyDialogueEnding()</span>
                Happens when you go from the monster dialogue state to the defending state.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function">DefenseEnding()</span>
                Happens when you go from the defending state of the game to any other state. If you read up on the
                <span class="term">RandomEncounterText()</span> function, you'll want to use it here.

                spareable or not. This event fires <i>after</i> the sparing of monsters is completed. If you spare the

				<span class="CYF"></span> In CYF, you can use the Inventory object to edit the player's inventory.

            <p>
                <br><span class="function">EnteringState(newstate, oldstate)</span>
                A new, more flexible way of handling state changes. When you enter a new state, this function will fire
                with <i>newstate</i> containing the new state's name, and <i>oldstate</i> containing the previous
                state's name. Both are in all caps. One of the most powerful things about it is that you can use <span class="term">State()</span>
                here to interrupt state changes initiated by the engine itself.
                <br>
                <br>Possible states and when they execute are below:
            </p>

                </li><br>
                <li><span class="term">ATTACKING</span> - When you've selected a target with the FIGHT option.</li><br>
                <li><span class="term">DEFENDING</span> - When the enemy/enemies finish dialogue, and one or more waves start.</li><br>

                <li><span class="term">ACTMENU</span> - When you've selected an ACT target, and must now select an ACT command.</li><br>

                <li><span class="term">MERCYMENU</span> - When you've selected MERCY.</li><br>
                <li><span class="term">ENEMYDIALOGUE</span> - When your enemy/enemies start their dialogue.</li><br>
                <li><span class="term">DIALOGRESULT</span> - When you call <span class="term">BattleDialog()</span>, or when the UI shows text on its own

                Update function is required to exist at the beginning of the encounter. If you define it at a later
                point in time, it will not get executed.
            </p>

            <h4>Monster script events</h4>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function">HandleAttack(damage)</span>
                Happens the moment the player's attack has applied damage - this is when you hear the hitting sound
                after the slash animation. <span class="term">damage</span> will be -1 if the player pressed Fight, but didn't press any
                buttons and let it end by itself. The monster's <span class="term">hp</span> variable will have updated at this time, too.
                Don't call <span class="term">BattleDialog()</span> here, it's a bit buggy right now.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function">OnDeath()</span>
                Happens after your attack's shaking animation has completed and the monster's HP is 0. If you implement
                <span class="term">OnDeath()</span>, your monster will not die automatically, and you will have to do it manually with the Kill()
                function. OnDeath() will only happen through monster kills that happened with the FIGHT command;
                scripted <span class="term">Kill()</span> calls will not trigger it. Calling <span class="term">BattleDialog()</span> here will probably 
				screw up the battle UI.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="CYF"></span>OnSpare()</span>
                Happens after you successfully spared a monster. If you implement <span class="term">OnSpare()</span>, your monster will not be
				spared automatically, and you will have to do it manually with the <span class="term">Spare()</span> function. <span class="term">OnSpare()
				</span> will only happen through a monster spare that happened with the SPARE command - scripted <span class="term">Spare()</span> calls will 
				not trigger it.
            </p>
			<p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="CYF"></span>BeforeDamageCalculation()</span>
                Happens before the damage calculation after pressing Z when attacking. You can easily use <span class="term">SetDamage()</span>
				in this function and lots of other animations and such.
				<br><i>Previous name: <span class="term">OnAttack()</span></i>
            </p>
			<p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="CYF"></span>BeforeDamageValues()</span>
                Happens before the damage ui is displayed on the monster (the life bar and the damage number) and before
				the hp changing. You can still change the target with <span class="term">Player.changeTarget(targetNumber)</span> in this function.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function">HandleCustomCommand(actcommand)</span>
                Happens when you select an Act command on this monster. <span class="term">actcommand</span> will be the same as how you
                defined it in the <span class="term">commands</span> list, except it will be <i>in all caps</i>. Intermediate example
                below, showing how you can use it and spice it up a little.
            </p>
            <div class="code-container">
  <pre class="brush:lua;">
commands = {"Sing", "Dance", "Wiggle"} --somewhere at the beginning
wigglecounter = 0 --let's keep a counter to check how often we've wiggled
 
function HandleCustomCommand(command)
	if command == "SING" then
		BattleDialog({"You sing your heart out. It's in the arena now."})
	elseif command == "DANCE" then
		BattleDialog({"You busted out your best moves."})
	elseif command == "WIGGLE" then
		if wigglecounter == 0 then --you can use variables to make commands more exciting!
			BattleDialog({"You just kind of stood there and wiggled."})
		elseif wigglecounter == 1 then
			BattleDialog({"You're still kind of standing there and wiggling."})
		else
			BattleDialog({"Your wiggled so often that your wiggling technique\ris now legendary."})
		end
		wigglecounter = wigglecounter + 1 --be sure to increase the wiggle counter, or it'll stay at 0
	end
end
</pre>
            </div>
            <h4>Wave script events</h4>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function">Update()</span>
                This function is launched every frame (usually at 60FPS) while monsters are attacking (the defense step). That's pretty
                much it. Update your bullets here - more on bullet creation and control is on the <span class="ref">API - Projectile
                management</span> page.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="CYF"></span>EndingWave()</span>
                This function is launched just before the wave ends. It permits you to easily reset some variables and other such things.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br><span class="function">OnHit(bullet)</span>
                Every time a bullet collides with a player, this function gets called on the script that created the
                projectile. The bullet object in this function can be modified if you feel like it. For more information
                on the bullet object, see the documentation above.<br>
                <br>
                If you implement this function in your script, you have to define manually what should happen after
                bullet collision. This is what allows you to create orange, cyan and green projectiles, and much much
                more. If you don't implement this function in your wave script, it'll stick to the default of dealing 3
                damage on hit.<!-- Below are multiple examples of how to use this function. -->
            </p>
        </div>

            <h2>Functions &amp; Objects</h2><br><br>
            <p>
                This section details functions Unitale adds to your Lua scripts to interact with the game in various
                ways. All functions will have a suffix in square brackets to denote in which scripts they may be used.
                The key for this is E for Encounter, M for Monster and W for Wave. If, for example, a function can be
                used in all scripts, it will be written as <i>functionName() [E/M/W]</i>.
            </p>
			
			<p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="CYF"></span> isCYF [E/M/W]</span>
				A value - true by default - that indicates that if you're on CYF. nil if not on CYF. Test it with
				<span class="term">if not isCYF then</span> or <span class="term">if isCYF then</span>.
            </p>
			
			<p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="CYF"></span> safe [E/M/W]</span>
				True if CYF's safe mode is enabled, false otherwise.
            </p>
			
			<p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="CYF"></span> windows [E/M/W]</span>
				Returns true if the user is on Windows, false otherwise.
            </p>
			
			<p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="CYF"></span> CYFversion [E/M/W]</span>
				Returns the current version of CYF. For example: for CYF 0.4.5, it'll return "0.4.5".
            </p>

            <p>
                <br><span class="function">DEBUG(text) [E/M/W]</span>
                Write text to the debug console (toggleable with <span class="term">F9</span>). It will appear automatically the first time you
                write text to it. You can use this to check values in your code, or make sure some pieces of code are
                actually running.
            </p>

            <p>
                <br><span class="function">SetGlobal(your_variable_name, value) [E/M/W]</span>
				DEPRECATED. Instead, set variables in the Encounter script, as it is accessible from everywhere.
                <br>You can retrieve these variables with <span class="term">Encounter.GetVar("yourvar")</span> or <span class="term">Encounter["yourvar"]
				</span> and set them with </span>Encounter.SetVar("yourvar", value)</span> or <span class="term">Encounter["yourvar"] = value.</span> 
				(For more info, scroll down and look for <span class="term">The Script object (and the Encounter object)</span>)<br>
                Sets a global variable. After setting, you can retrieve it from all your scripts at any time with
                <span class="term">GetGlobal(variable_name)</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                <br><span class="function">GetGlobal(your_variable_name) returns variable [E/M/W]</span>
				DEPRECATED. Instead, set variables in the Encounter script, as it is accessible from everywhere.
                <br>Gets a Global Variable that you previously set using <span class="term">SetGlobal()</span>.
            </p>

                <br><span class="function"><span class="CYF"></span> SetRealGlobal(your_variable_name, value) [E/M/W]</span>
                Sets a Global variable that is accessible even in the overworld. After setting it, you can retrieve it from all of
				your scripts at any time with <span class="term">GetRealGlobal(variable_name)</span>.
				Persists through battles, but not between sessions. These variables can be saved using the overworld save system.<br>
                Can be used on the overworld.
            </p>

            <p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="CYF"></span> GetRealGlobal(your_variable_name) returns variable [E/M/W]</span>
                Gets a Global that you previously set using <span class="term">SetRealGlobal()</span>.<br>
                Can be used on the overworld.
            </p>

            <p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="CYF"></span> SetAlMightyGlobal(your_variable_name, value) [E/M/W]</span>
                <i>AlMighty Globals</i> are globals that are instantly saved into a file when set: these globals persists
				through sessions, even in devMod mode, and can't be removed.
				However, you can still access the "Remove AlMighty Globals" button in devMod to remove them.<br>
                Can be used on the overworld.
            </p>

            <p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="CYF"></span> GetAlMightyGlobal(your_variable_name) returns variable [E/M/W]</span>
                Gets an AlMighty Global that you previously set using <span class="term">SetAlMightyGlobal()</span>.<br>
                Can be used on the overworld.
            </p>
			
			<p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="CYF"></span> SetFrameBasedMovement(bool) [E/M/W]</span>
				Set to "true" if you want a frame-based player movement (2px/frame) instead of a time based player movement (120px/s).
				Set it to "false" if you already are in a frame-based movement and you want to go back to a time based movement.
            </p>

            <p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="CYF"></span> SetAction("FIGHT" or "ACT") [E/M/W]</span>
                Used alongside <span class="term">EnteringState</span> to force the player to go on FIGHT or ACT. Does nothing outside of this function.
            </p>
           
            <p>         
                <br><span class="function"><span class="CYF"></span> AllowPlayerDef(bool) [E/M/W]</span>
                If this value is set to true, all damage that the player will take will be reduced - like in Undertale - by 1 point for each 5 defense,
                with the player's defense at LV1 not affecting the damage.<br/>
                Each damage that is originally positive but lower than 1 will be replaced by 1.
				<br>False by default.

            <p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="CYF"></span> SetPPCollision(bool) [E/M/W]</span>
                Setting this to true will force all bullets that don't have a specified collision type to use the Pixel-Perfect collision system.
				If you want to use it, then I'd highly recommend seeing <span class="ref">The Pixel-Perfect Collision System</span>.
				<br>False by default.
            </p>

            <p>
                <br><span class="function">BattleDialog(list_of_strings) [E/M/W]</span>
                This makes the list of strings you give to the function appear in the UI dialog box. After skipping through
                them, you will automatically go to the monster dialogue step by default. Below is a working example of
                how you could use it for a Vegetoid encounter.
            </p>
            <div class="code-container">
   <pre class="brush: lua;">
function HandleCustomCommand(command)
	if command == "DINNER" then
		if ate_greens then -- ate_greens is a non-default variable, of course
			currentdialogue = {"Ate\nYour\nGreens"}
		else
			currentdialogue = {"Eat\nYour\nGreens"}
		end
		BattleDialog({"You pat your stomach.\nVegetoid offers a healthy meal."})
	end
end
</pre>
                <p>(For the Lua specialists; it is indeed a table of strings rather than a list of strings.)</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                <br><span class="function">State(state_to_go_to) [E/M/W]</span>
                A powerful function that immediately skips the battle to the specified state, rather than following the
                default conventions. Below is a list of valid strings you can pass to it, what state you'll be going to
                and what that state entails. The states you pass to it are case-invariant, but uppercase is recommended
                for readability.</p>
			<p>
			Arguably the best part about <span class="term">State</span> is that it can be used in conjunction with the text command <span class="term">
			[func]</span> to change the state from within your dialogue. An example is below - this will have a monster say that he will
			not fight you, then return to the action select screen rather than launching an attack.</p>
            <div class="code-container">
			<pre class="brush: lua;">currentdialogue = {"I won't fight you.", "[func:State,ACTIONSELECT]"}</pre>
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="term">ACTIONSELECT</span> - While in this state, you can select FIGHT/ACT/ITEM/MERCY.</li><br>
                <li><span class="term">ENEMYDIALOGUE</span> - When starting this state, <span class="term">currentdialogue</span> gets read from the 
					Encounter script for every monster and their dialogue is displayed. If that doesn't exist, it'll return something at
                    random from the <span class="term">randomdialogue</span> list.
                </li><br>
                <li><span class="term">DEFENDING</span> - When starting this state, <span class="term">nextwaves</span> is read out from the Encounter 
					script and all scripts in the Waves folder with matching names will be part of this defense step. <span class="term">wavetimer</span>
                    is also read from the Encounter script at this time.
                </li><br>
			</ul>
			<p>
			There are some other states available, but entering some might have nasty side effects. It's possible that
			they might lock up your battle if you enter them with <span class="term">State</span>. So, use at your own risk:
			<ul>
				<li><span class="term">ATTACKING</span> - Starting this state will put you in the screen where you either deal damage to an enemy by pressing
				"Z" at the right time, or you wait and miss entirely. The enemy this affects is the same as the last enemy selected in the states <span class=
				"term">ENEMYSELECT</span> or <span class="term">ACTMENU</span>. After this state ends, the encounter moves on to the <span class="term">
				ENEMYDIALOGUE</span> state by default.</li><br>
				<li><span class="term">ENEMYSELECT</span> - This state displays a list of all active enemies in the encounter. This state gets entered
				automatically after choosing FIGHT or ACT. If the Player got here from choosing FIGHT, the state loaded from pressing "Z" is <span class=
				"term">ATTACKING</span>, if they got here from choosing ACT, that state will be <span class="term">ACTMENU</span>, but if they got here from
				calling <span class="term">State</span> and press "Z", nothing will happen.</li><br>
				<li><span class="term">ACTMENU</span> - This state displays all of the options from the enemy's <span class="term">commands</span> in order. 
				If the enemy has <span class="term">cancheck</span> set to <i>true</i>, then a "Check" option will be displayed here - which
				will follow the syntax seen in the description for <span class="term">commands</span> as seen in <span class="ref">Basic Setup</span>. 
				Having more than 6 ACT commands may cause glitchiness, though, so watch out! (Additional note: the enemy chosen will always be the same as
				the last enemy chosen in <span class="term">ENEMYSELECT</span>.)</li><br>
				<li><span class="term">ITEMMENU</span> - This state shows all of the player's available items. It's tied with the
				<span class="term">HandleItem</span> function (see <span class="ref">Game events</span> for more information).</li><br>
				<li><span class="term">MERCYMENU</span> - This state lets you choose from either "Spare" or "Flee". If at least one active enemy
				has <span class="term">canspare</span> set to <i>true</i>, then "Spare" will be yellow - and selecting it will spare that enemy.
				Otherwise, if the option is not yellow, then choosing "Spare" will activate the encounter function <span class="term">HandleSpare</span>.
				Also, choosing "Flee" prompts some (not necessarily) hilarious messages.<br><span class="CYF"></span> If the encounter was entered from the
				overworld, choosing "Flee" allows the player to flee the battle and return to the overworld.</li><br>
				<li><span class="term">DIALOGRESULT</span> - This is the state that is entered whenever <span class="term">BattleDialog</span> is called,
				when the victory message displays, when the player fails to flee, or when an item is used. When all text is done and the player presses 
				"Z", the state <span class="term">ENEMYDIALOGUE</span> is entered next. Also, note that the soul is invisible during this
				state, so anything you could do to change its sprite won't be visible until afterwards.</li><br>
            </ul>
			<p>
			Finally, there are three states that are <i>never</i> entered during regular gameplay. These include:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="term">DONE</span> - The most functional of the three non-regular states. Currently, this immediately returns you to the mod 
				selection screen.</li><br>
				<li><span class="term">NONE</span> - A mostly-deprecated state. Technically, this <i>is</i> entered in regular gameplay - but only once:
				in the very first frame of the encounter. When entered manually, it freezes the entire battle. If called in
				<span class="term">EncounterStarting</span>, the soul will appear at the bottom-left corner of the screen. During this state,
				absolutely nothing occurs. No regular inputs do anything, enemies' dialogues don't advance, bullets don't move - nothing.</li><br>
				<li><span style="color:#ffffff;border-bottom:1px solid #ffffff;"><0.2.1a></span> <span class="term">RESETTING</span> - This state
				is 100% deprecated. It's something lvkuln left behind in Unitale v0.2.1a, but removed in the open-source (github) release. 
				Previous testing shows that this state will only "exist" for a single frame when entered, before the player is returned to their
				previous state, just before the encounter freezes up. However, if it's called on every single frame during the state
				<span class="term">DEFENDING</span>, the wave's <span class="term">Update</span> function is never called. This state was likely only used 
				for testing - and it has been removed in CYF.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
                <br><span class="function"><span class="CYF"></span> GetCurrentState() [E/M/W]</span>
				Returns the name of the current state (see above for all states).
            </p>

            <p>
                <br><span class="function">The Player object [E/M/W]</span>
                You can use this object to obtain information about the player. Since the player is always 16x16 pixels
                in Undertale, you can add/subtract 8 from the player's horizontal/vertical position to get the edges of
                the player's hitbox, if you need that for anything.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="term">Player.sprite</span> - the Player's soul sprite component. See the <span class="ref">Sprites &amp; Animation</span> 
					section for usage details.
                </li><br>
                <li><span class="term">Player.hp</span> - get or set the player's current HP. Can't exceed max HP. If set to 0, game over
                    triggers.<br>
					<span class="CYF"></span> * The hp value is now a float, but there can be some problems about accuracy of float values.
                </li><br>
                <li><span class="CYF"></span> <span class="term">Player.maxhp</span> (readonly) - returns the player's MaxHP value. <br> 
					* The hp value is now a float, but there can be some problems about accuracy of float values.
                </li><br>
                <li><span class="CYF"></span> <span class="term">Player.MaxHPShift</span> (readonly) - returns the difference between the player's current Max HP and their normal, 
				unmodified Max HP.
				<br>* The hp value is now a float, but there can be some problems about accuracy of float values.
                </li><br>

                Script objects are a bit of a special case. They're used to refer to other scripts that were loaded by
                the engine itself. In the encounter script, the <i>enemies</i> table is filled with Script objects after
                the encounter starts and the <i>Wave</i> table is filled with Script object in the state <span class="term">DEFENDING</span>. The Encounter 
				object is also a script object that refers to the current encounter, and is accessible from anywhere except from the Encounter itself. Take 
				note of the different way of accessing variables.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="term">script.GetVar("variable_name")</span> - gets <span class="term">variable_name</span> from the script.</li><br>
                <li><span class="term">script["variable_name"]</span> - same as the above.</li><br>
                <li><span class="term">script.SetVar("variable_name", value)</span> - sets <span class="term">variable_name</span> on the script.</li><br>

                The Time object serves as a way to retrieve game timing without having to keep track of it yourself, or
                using a frame counter. Whenever possible, try using the Time object over a frame-based timing method to
                ensure equal behaviour across all framerates.

                    subtract <span class="term">Time.time</span> from your stored time to calculate the difference.
                </li><br>

                    ~2.0 at 30FPS, etc. By multiplying your movement by this value, your waves will be consistent on

            <h2>Create Your Frisk: RhenaudTheLukark's Overworld basics</h2><br><br>
           
            <h3>Presentation</h3><br><br>
           
            <p>
                Create Your Frisk is different from Unitale by its numerous new features, but none other than the overworld
                is the key feature that everyone was waiting to deal with for a long time.<br>
                So I'm finally able and proud to give an access to the overworld feature, that includes an efficient event handler
                with a lot of functions that you'll be able to use to create your own Undertale-like fangame!<br>
                However, to be able to use the overworld part of CYF, you will need to have a minimum of experience with Unity and
                know at least GameObjects' mechanisms.
            </p>
           
            <h3>Get Started</h3><br><br>
           
            <p>
                To get started, you'll need first of all to download the current version CYF uses (at the moment I wrote this part
                of the documentation, the version was 5.6.0f3) and of course download the project via
                <a href="https://github.com/RhenaudTheLukark/CreateYourFrisk">Github</a>.<br>
                Unity may take a lot of time to install and to load the project for the first time due to a lot of resources being
                registered by Unity, but you won't have to do it in the future.<br>
                Once you're in, you'll have to load the scene Assets/Scenes/Disclaimer.unity using the command File => Open Scene
                at the top left corner of Unity's window.<br>
                You can start CYF either from the Disclaimer, from the Intro or from the TitleScreen scenes. It's up to you to find
                your way to work on CYF!<br>
                Then you have it! You can launch CYF and you'll be ready to start fiddling with the engine! If you followed these
                rules and for some reason CYF won't launch, you may want to contactme directly via Discord or Reddit. In this case,
                please get <a href="https://www.teamviewer.com/fr/">TeamViewer</a>, it's a software that permits you to share your
                screen with other users online, so that I'll be able to see what's wrong.
            </p>
           
            <h3>How does it work?</h3><br><br>

            <p>
                Some softwares will have to be used to be able to create an overworld in CYF. First of all, you can use a software
                called <a href="http://www.mapeditor.org/">Tiled</a> that permits you to create maps out of tilesets, images that
                contain tiles used to fill in maps. This tiling system being absent from Unity but easier to use to create a map,
                I thought that being able to translate a Tiled map to an Unity scene thanks to Tiled2Unity would be a great idea.<br>
                Well, now we're going deep into the details. If you still haven't learned Unity's basics, you should look up to it
                beforehand, as some technical language may be used here.<br>
                There are mostly two things to look at when making a map: the map itself (how the map will be) and the events (how
                the map will work). Let's go deep further into the details.<br>
                As I said above, each map is translated into a scene. This scene will have to contain at minimum one element, and
                it's the map object called Background. To see more about how to create a map, I suggest you to look at the tutorial
                on how to create a map.<br>
                Then, the events. These are universal and used the same way, at the exception of one "add-on" that is a CYFAnimator
                component. The events have different function-launching conditions, such as pressing the confirm button to launch it,
                colliding with it, it being launched automatically or the function being launched as a parallel process. The
                functions themselves have to be created in Lua scripts, like battles. To see more about how to use the events, you
                should look at the tutorial on how to create an event.<br>
                Of course, there are other things to see, but these are the two main sides of CYF's overworld coding. Now look at the
                functions to be able to do whatever you want to do!
            </p>
           
            <h3>The event code</h3><br><br>
           
            <p>
                For a long time, events' code was accessible and could be modified by going in YOURMOD/Lua/Events/. Maybe that you
                already fiddled with them, maybe not. Now that the system is stable and easier to use, event programming may be as
                easy as creating a battle: all that you have to do is to follow the documentation and know what you're doing.<br>
                The overworld has a debugger like battles' (and it's used the same way). Use DEBUG(value) to print your value in the
                debugger, if it's a string value. <br>
                Audio, NewAudio, Inventory, Input, Misc and Time objects used in battles are
                usable in the overworld too, as well as RealGlobals and AlMightyGlobals access. Finally, the variables isCYF, safe,
                windows and CYFversion are also accessible.

            <h2>The Overworld: How to create a map on Unity with Tiled2Unity</h2><br><br>
            
            <p>
                Creating a map for CYF is not that difficult. All that you need to do is following the next rules. 
                There are many of them, but as long as you stick to them, it should be fine.
            </p>

            <p>
                The very first step is to create the map on Tiled, and save it.<br>
                <u>Tip:</u> Undertale's tiles are 20x20 pixels, with a scale coefficient of 2: I suggest you to 
                make a tileset of 40x40px tiles to not be worried about a scale value of 2.
            </p>
            
            <br><img src="img/Tiled2Unity screenshot.png" alt="Tiled2Unity screenshot"><br><br>
            <p>
                <li>Open Tiled2Unity.exe</li>
                <li>File --> Choose your .tmx file</li>
                <li>Export To --> PathToCYF\Assets\Tiled2Unity\Tiled2Unity.export.txt</li>
                <li>Click the Big Ass Export Button</li>
                <li>Close Tiled2Unity, go on Unity</li>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <li>Now that you're on Unity, you should create a scene, then delete the Main Camera object, save and name the map 
                (the name will be important!)</li>
                <li>Open the scene Assets\Scenes\test3.unity, copy all its content and paste it into your newly created scene.</li>
                <li>On the Project tab, go to Assets\Tiled2Unity\Prefabs, you should see your map. Click and
                  drag it in the scene's arborescence. (Put it in the root, not in a directory)</li>
                <li>Go to Assets\Resources\Prefabs and include Main Camera OW like you did with the previous 
                  line. Now you should be able to see something on the Game tab!</li>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <li>Remove the map in Background, disable the objects Foreground and Bottom by clicking on the object, going to the 
                  Inspector and unchecking the box right next to the object's name.</li>
                <li>Move your map to make so the bottom-left corners of the map and the camera are at the same coordinates.</li>
                <li>Delete everything that is in the GameObject Background excepted the TPs. You'll see that 
                  your map object is composed of every layer that you've added in your map.<br>
                  Now, you'll have to move into Background the main object component of your map and the 
                  colliders (in your object layers).<br>
                  If Unity asks you if you want to break the prefab, say "Yes".</li>
                <li>If there are other layers, Just put them in the root.</li>
                <li>Delete the object which contained all the map elements.</li>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <li>Make so Background's RectTransform fits the map. It's very important, as the RectTransform 
                  bounds are used for map scrolling.<br>
                  <u>Tips:</u> 
                  <ul>
                      <li>Put all of Background's children in the root or as the chile of another object so 
                        that their position isn't changed while moving Background.</li>
                      <li>Then, Background's RectTransform size is equal to bounds of the map / 100: if your
                        map is 640x480, the size will be 6.4 and 4.8.</li>
                      <li>Now center the main map object to make it fit Background's RectTransform.</li>
                      <li>Don't forget that Background's RectTransform's bottom-left corner must be at the 
                        same coordinates than Main Camera OW's RectTransform's bottom-left corner!</li>
                      <li>And now when everything is ok put Background's old children back at their original place.</li>
                  </ul></li>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <li>For each map component, go to the component "Sorting Layer Exposed" and set the value 
                  "Order in Layer" to 0.</li>
                <li>For each map component, you'll need to set the Z value of the map. The Z value go like 
                  this: the greater it is, the further it'll be.<br>
                  Set Background's Z value to 140, then play around this value to set the Z value of other 
                  background layers (between 139 and 141, you can use decimal numbers, of course).<br>
                  For foreground layers' Z value, you should take values between -1.5 and -0.5.<br>
                  Warning: The maps' Z value must be set to 0 after setting the layers' Z value!</li>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <li>Edit, add and/or remove the TP objects. You'll have to set some values for the TP: see the 
                  component TP Handler.
                  <ul>
                      <li>Scene Name = Name of the destination scene of the TP.</li>
                      <li>Position = Position of the player in the destination map, from the bottom-left corner of 
                      the map.</li>
                      <li>Direction = Direction of the player after the TP. 2 = Bottom, 4 = Left, 6 = Right, 8 = Up .
                      (I used the NumPad for this, yeah ^^)</li>
                      <li>Activated = Boolean used when the TP is launched. don't activate it manually!</li>
                  </ul></li>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <li>Change the layer of all the colliders: give them the layer BlockingLayer.<br>
                  <u>Tip:</u> Select the first one, then shift-click on the last one. Then, you can change the 
                      layer off all objects simultaneously!</li>
                <li>Finally, modify the data in the object Background, the Map Infos Component.
                  <ul>
                      <li>ID = ID of the map. Used in the database to register event states. Must be unique.</li>
                      <li>Music = Name of the BGM played on the map. The BGM must be in the folder Audio of the mod 
                        or the default folder.</li>
                      <li>Mod To Load = Name of the mod loaded by the map.</li>
                      <li>Beginning Position = Position of the player in the first map, from the bottom-left corner 
                        of the map.</li>
                  </ul></li>
                <li>When everything is ready, remove the Main Camera OW object and save the map.</li>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Your map is now ready! But it isn't playable yet... Before testing it, we'll need to add it to the Build.<br>
                When you're on your newly created map, open File --> Build Settings...<br>
                Click on the button "Add Open Scenes" while you're on your map: it must now be in the list of Scenes in the
                Build: it'll be built with the project and it can now be used!
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>Now is time to test it!</h3><br><br>
                <li>Open the scene "Assets\Scenes\TransitionOverworld.unity" and search for the GameObject 
                  "Main Camera OW".<br>
                  Go to the component Transition Overworld and change the values.
                  First Level To Load: Name of the first scene to load.
                  First Mod Folder: Name of the mod folder of the first scene to load.</li>
              <li>Load the scene Disclaimer.unity and launch the game. Launch a new game if you've already 
                  saved: you should now be on your map!</li>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Make some tests on the map if there are problems. If there are 0 problem, now you can add 
                some events!<br>

            <h2>The Overworld: How to create an event on Unity</h2><br><br>

            <p>
                If you want to make a good map, creating events is something that you might want to get used to.<br>
                Making events is not complicated, you just need to know what you need to tweak to be able to make one.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <li>The first thing that you'll have to do is of course opening the map you want to add the event in.</li>
                <li>As you may have seen in the previous tutorial, Unity uses "prefabs". These are generic objects that can 
                be used in different scenes across the project. Here, you'd want to go to the Project tab and go to 
                Assets/Resources/prefabs to see those.<br>
                The one that interests us here is the "Event1" prefab. Click and drag it to the GameObject list to createan itance of this prefab.</li>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Now the event is ready! Simple, isn't it? However, you'd ant to modify it now, keeping the object like this is not recommended.<br>
                What will follow is a list of things that you can modify.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <li>GameObject ~ Name: All events must have a different name, so find one that fits this event!</li>
                <li>RectTransform ~ PosX/PosY: It's the position of the event.</li>
                <li>RectTransform ~ Anchors: Anchor of the event. Set them at the same value!</li>
                <li>RectTransform ~ Pivot: Pivot of the event. It changes the object's position!</li>
                <li>SpriteRenderer ~ Sprite: It's not what will be used to display the sprite. You can use it to see if the event's sprite looks good 
                    and to modify the event's hitbox, though.</li>
                <li>BoxCollider ~ Edit Collider Button: Permits you to modify the event's hitbox.</li>
                <li>BoxCollider ~ Is Trigger: Must be activated for Touch events.</li>
                <li>BoxCollider ~ Offset/Size: Same as the Edit Collider Button.</li>
                <li>EventOW ~ Script To Load: Name of the event script to load when triggering this event. The event must be in the directory MAPMOD/Lua/Events/.</li>
                <li>EventOW ~ Actual Page: The first page of the event (and in game the current page of the event)</li>
                <li>EventOW ~ Event Triggers: This part MUST NOT be forgotten. Even if it doesn't seem to be, it's the most important part of the event.<br>
                                              In your event, you'll need to name all your functions following the pattern "EventPage" + Page number.<br>
                                              For each X value, you'll input the Page number, and for their matching Y value you'll need to input the trigger type of the event.<br>
                                              0 = Confirm button, 1 = Touch the hitbox, 2 = Auto, 3 = Parallel event.</li>
                <li>EventOW ~ Move Speed: The speed of the event in px/frame if you move the event.</li>
                <li>AutoloadRessourcesFromRegistry ~ Sprite Path: Path of the sprite from MAPMOD/Sprites.</li>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                And then you'll need to create your event's script. It needs to be located at MAPMOD/Lua/Events.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                If you want to permanently disable an event in-game, set its event page to -1. It'll be automatically deleted when you'll re-enter the map.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                All the others must not be changed, unless you know what you're doing (excepted some self-explanatory values like SpriteRenderer ~ FlipX/FlipY)
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>

            <h2>The Overworld: How to add an animation to an event</h2><br><br>
           
            <p>
                Tired of all these static events? Do you want them to be animated, to bring more life to your map? You're in the good section!<br>
                Animating events is (again) something very easy, but it may be long. This animator is used like sprite.SetAnimation(), only the way to fill in the data changes.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <li>All the animations are driven by a component named "CYFAnimator". Click on the event you want to add this component in, go at the very bottom of the Inspector 
                  tab and click on the button "Add component".</li>
                <li>Enter "CYFAnimator" and you should be able to find it. Click and it'll be added in the object.</li>
            </p>
            
            <br><img src="img/CYFAnimator screenshot.png" alt="CYFAnimator screenshot"><br><br>
            <p>
                This is a working example of CYFAnimator object. The 8 anims pictured here are the minimum required to make the component run correctly.                
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Now you should be able to see some variables. Here is a description of them:
                <li>Movement Direction: It's the direction the event goes, you normally don't need to modify it as the component will compute it by itself.</li>
                <li>Begin Anim: It's the name of the anim the event will start on.</li>
                <li>Special Header: This variable is used to modify the event's animation scheme. Normally the event will launch the anims StopDown, 
                StopUp, Moving Down, MovingUp and the others, but if you add this header it'll be added at the beginning of this name.<br>
                That means that if the special header is "Frisk", the CYFAnimator component will launch FriskMovingDown, FriskMovingUp... instead of the others.<br>
                There is one exception to this scheme. If the special header is equal to an anim's name, this anim will be launched while the special header won't be changed.</li>
                <li>Anims: Your list of anims. Check the screenshot above to see how you should fill it.</li>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                And that's it for animated events! As I said, the biggest part here is to fill in the Anims list, so it's not much of a deal!<br>

            <p>
                Events have a very particular way to work: they are read then exec, that is to say that the compiler
                reads the entire function, and then, if there is changed value within the code in a function as
                SetChoice, the function has to be read again, so if you have set a global variable, it will be set
                again, if you doesn't do what's necessary.
                <br>Plus, some iterations will not work, as while iterations. I made something to replace it, you'll see
                this later.

            <p>
                The overworld system creates by itself some local variables. Here's the list of variables that you may
                need:

                <li>Variables created after a choice: "Temp" + ID. By default, it will be 1, if 1 is already taken,
                    it'll be 2 etc...</li><br>
                <li>Variables created after a return point: "ReturnPoint" + ID. It uses the same generation technique
                    than variables from choices.</li><br>

                These variables' use case will be detailed further in the documentation. Keep reading!</document>

                For example, if I activate the Switch "MovingLeft" while on the anim "DownIdle", I'll go to the anim

                It was hard to customize items and such in Unitale, right? Plus, items won't go if you used them,
                because they are the only ones that will ever love you. But now, nobody loves you at all, because items
                can be deleted and the Inventory System has been simplified! Here are the functions that are created to

			<h2>Create Your Frisk: The Pixel-Perfect Collision System</h2><br><br>
			<p>
				Do you have enough of all of these rectangular collisions and thousands of lines of special collision
				condition in OnHit()? Well the Pixel-Perfect Collision System is made for YOU!
				<br>You can use it for the entire encounter with SetPPCollision(bool) or on a special bullet with
				bullet.ppcollision. The bullet's ppcollision value will override the encounter's ppcollision value.
				<br>Wait a minute before rushing on the Pixel-Perfect Collision System like this...or wait, do as you want!
				Now the Pixel-Perfect Collision System supports bullets with scale!	You can rotate the bullets (this is why
				it took me one week to make it) and move them like you always did!
				<br>One more thing: the Pixel-Perfect Collision System is more ressourceful than the Normal Collision
				System. So, I'll warn you: you better use the Pixel-Perfect Collision System for the bullets that needs
				it, and not for all bullets.
				<br>A last tip: Don't use Pixel-Perfect for non-damaging bullets, it'll only add some lag!

			<h2>Create Your Frisk: The Text Object</h2><br><br>
			<p>
				A lot of people were waiting for this one: I'm proud to present you the Text Object! With it, you can create a text
				wherever you want, with a bubble or without a bubble, with a speech thing or without a speech thing... It's 100%
				your choice!<br>
				Plus, if you choose to make a bubble, the height of the bubble is automatically computed, but you can still choose the
				bubble's height if you want to.<br>
                Per default, a Text Object has a bubble with a auto computed height with no speech thing. Plus, they are hidden when you
				enter and come out of ENEMYDIALOGUE. If you want to change this, you have a lot of functions to do so. Look down to see them!
			</p>
			<p>
				<br><span class="function">CreateText(Table text, Table position, int textWidth, string layer = "BelowPlayer", int bubbleHeight = -1) returns TextObject [E/M/W]</span>
				This function creates a Text Object and returns it. However, as you can see, a lot of parameters are needed, here is what you should put:
				<ul>
				    <li>text - Your text, like you set them in BattleDialog() or enemy.currentdialogue: {"this is a text n°1", "this is a text n°2}</li><br>
				    <li>position - The position of the center of the object. Sorry if it may be hard to place it, but you'll be able to use SetPivot()
					to place it better afterwards. You only need two numbers, if you add more nothing will be done with them: {320, 240}</li><br>
				    <li>textWidth - You'll always need the text's width! The bubble's width will be 20px larger than the text's width. One last thing,
					bubbles have a minimum width of 40: 150</li><br>
				    <li>layer - The sprite layer of the Text Object. If it doesn't exist, it returns an error. This argument is optional, the Text Object
					will be in the layer BelowPlayer if you don't set this value: "BelowArena"</li><br>
				    <li>bubbleHeight - You can enter a static bubble height here if you want to. Per default, it'll be -1, the value used to auto compute
					the height of the bubble. However, bubbles have a minimum height of 40: 150</li><br>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				<br><span class="function">Text.progressmode</span>
				This value is used to set the progression mode of the text: "auto" will launch the next line after a given number of frames set in
				Text.SetAutoWaitTimeBetweenFrames(), "manual" will need the player to press the Confirm button to launch the next line and "none"
				means that you'll need to manually display the next line in your code with Text.NextLine().
			</p>
			<p>
				<br><span class="function">Text.x</span>
				The absolute x position of the bubble, from the bottom left corner of the screen. This value depends from the object's pivot.
			</p>
			<p>
				<br><span class="function">Text.y</span>
				The absolute y position of the bubble, from the bottom left corner of the screen. This value depends from the object's pivot.
			</p>
			<p>
				<br><span class="function">Text.textWidth</span>
				Width of the text.  If the value is lower than 16, it'll be 16.
			</p>
			<p>
				<br><span class="function">Text.bubbleHeight</span>
				Height of the bubble. If the value is lower than 40, it'll be 40.
			</p>
			<p>
				<br><span class="function">Text.layer</span>
				The sprite layer of the Text Object. If it doesn't exist, it returns an error. "BelowPlayer" per default.
			</p>
			<p>
				<br><span class="function">Text.SetText(Table text)</span>
				Sets the text of the Text Object. If it became inactive, it'll reactive itself right away.
			</p>
			<p>
				<br><span class="function">Text.AddText(Table text)</span>
				Adds the given text to the current text. Acts like Text.SetText() if the text is already finished.
			</p>
			<p>
				<br><span class="function">Text.SetFont(string fontName)</span>
				Sets the font of the text. Can be easily replaced by the text command [font], but whatever.<br>
				Returns an error if the font doesn't exist.
			</p>
			<p>
				<br><span class="function">Text.SetEffect(string effect, float intensity)</span>
				Sets the effect of the text. Can be easily replaced be the text command [effect], but whatever.<br>
				Can only take "none", "twitch", "shake" or "twitch" as effect. If you want to use the basic intensity value, enter -1.
			</p>
			<p>
				<br><span class="function">Text.IsTheLineFinished() returns bool</span>
				If the current line is finished, this function will return true. Else, it'll return false.
			</p>
			<p>
				<br><span class="function">Text.IsTheTextFinished() returns bool</span>
				If the entire text is finished, this function will return true. Else, it'll return false.
			</p>
			<p>
				<br><span class="function">Text.ShowBubble(string side = null, int/string position = null)</span>
				Use this function to add a bubble to the text. You can also set the side and the position of the speech thing if you
				want to, look at Text.SetSpeechThingSideAndPosition() to see how to use it.
			</p>
			<p>
				<br><span class="function">Text.SetSpeechThingPositionAndSide(string side, int/string position = center)</span>
				Sets the size and position of the speech thing. The side can only take "left", "right", "up", "down" or "none" as value.<br>
				"none" is used to hide the speech thing, the other directions are the side where the speech thing is.<br>
				You have two ways to set the speech thing's position:
				<ul>
				    <li>An int for static position from the bottom of the bubble for "left" and "right" and from the left for "up" and "down".
					These are clamped from 0 to the bubble's height for "left"/"right" and to the bubble's width for "up"/"down".</li><br>
				    <li>A string for a percentage value. 0% is the bottom for "left"/"right" and the left for "up"/"right", 50% is the middle
					of the side and 100% is the top for "left"/"right" and the right for "up"/"down". The values are clamped from 0% to 100%</li><br>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				<br><span class="function">Text.HideBubble()</span>
				A function that hides the bubble.
			</p>
			<p>
				<br><span class="function">Text.NextLine()</span>
				Shows the next line of the text istantly, not regarding if the current line is finished nor the current progress mode.
			</p>
			<p>
				<br><span class="function">Text.MoveTo(int x, int y)</span>
				Moves the text to the given coordinates. These values depends from the object's pivot.
			</p>
			<p>
				<br><span class="function">Text.SetPivot(float x, float y)</span>
				Sets the pivot of the object. The pivot is the value where the text's position is set: the basis value is {0.5, 0.5},
				but if you set it to {0, 0}, each time you modify the object's position, you'll set the position of the bottom left corner of the
				object instead of its center. {1, 1} is the top right corner, {0, 1} the top left corner and {1, 0} the bottom right corner.
			</p>
			<p>
				<br><span class="function">Text.SetAutoWaitTimeBetweenTexts(int time)</span>
				Sets the time to wait after each line to launch the next line in the "auto" progress mode. The value time is given in frames.
			</p>
			<p>
				<br><span class="function">Text.MoveTo(int x, int y)</span>
				Moves the text at the position x, y from the bottom left corner of the window.
			</p>
			<p>
				<br><span class="function">Text.SetPivot(int x, int y)</span>
				Sets the pivot of the text object.

                drop it downwards. If it hits the bottom border of the arena, it'll bounce back up. Otherwise it'll

                Every time a bullet collides with a player, this function gets called on the script that created the
                projectile. The bullet object in this function can be modified if you feel like it. For more information
                on the bullet object, see the documentation above.<br>
                <br>
                If you implement this function in your script, you have to define manually what should happen after
                bullet collision. This is what allows you to create orange, cyan and green projectiles, and much much
                more. If you don't implement this function in your wave script, it'll stick to the default of dealing 3
                damage on hit. Below are multiple examples of how to use this function.</p>
            <div class="code-container">
  <pre class="brush:lua;">

            <ul>
                <li><span class="CYF"></span> <span class="term">sprite.isactive</span> (readonly) - In retromode, this is <i>true</i> if a sprite has been

				sprite from the <span class="term">Sprites/</span> folder.</li><br>
                <li><span class="term">sprite.x</span> - horizontal position of sprite relative to bottom left of screen, measured from its
                    pivot/anchor point (center by default). If parented, x position is relative to the parent.
                </li><br>
                <li><span class="term">sprite.y</span> - vertical position of sprite relative to bottom left of screen, measured from its
                    pivot/anchor point (center by default). If parented, y position is relative to the parent.
                </li><br>
                <li><span class="term">sprite.absx</span> - horizontal position of sprite relative to bottom left of screen, ignoring its

                </li><br>
                <li><span class="term">sprite.yscale</span> - vertical scaling of sprite (1.0 by default). 2.0 is twice as large, 0.5 half as

                </li><br>
                <li><span class="term">sprite.width</span> (readonly) - width of this sprite's image in pixels. This never changes until the

                <li><span class="term">sprite.height</span> (readonly) - height of this sprite's image in pixels. This never changes until the

                </li><br>
                <li><span class="term">sprite.color</span> - get or set the color, as a table of 3 values from 0 to 1. For example, <span class="term">
					sprite.color = {1.0, 0.0, 0.0}</span> makes it red. This actually overlays the sprite's original color, so if you want
                    full control over the color, make sure your sprite is white. Black areas are not affected by
                    coloration.
                </li><br>
                <li><span class="CYF"></span> <span class="term">sprite.color32</span> - get or set the color, as a table of 3 values from 0 to 255. For 
					example, <span class="term">sprite.color32 = {255, 0, 0}</span> makes it red. This actually overlays the sprite's original color, so if 
					you want full control over the color make sure your sprite is white. Black areas are not affected by
                    coloration.
                </li><br>

                <li><span class="CYF"></span> <span class="term">sprite.alpha32</span> - get or set sprite transparency, from 0 to 255.</li><br>
                <li><span class="term">sprite.rotation</span> - get or set sprite rotation, in degrees. It's clamped between 0 and 360, so if you
                    change it to 365 it becomes 5.
                </li><br>
                <li><span class="CYF"></span> <span class="term">sprite.layer</span> - the current layer of the sprite. You can set it, but if the layer

                <li><span class="CYF"></span> <span class="term">sprite.loopmode</span> - sets the loop mode of <span class="term">SetAnimation</span> 
					functions launched after this command. Can be:
				    <ul>
					    <li><span class="term">LOOP</span> - The default mode: when the animation is finished, it plays again. <span class="term">animcomplete
							</span> is always true with this mode.</li><br>
					    <li><span class="term">ONESHOT</span> - Plays the animation once, and keeps the last frame of the animation.</li><br>
					    <li><span class="term">ONESHOTEMPTY</span> - Same as <span class="term">ONESHOT</span>, except that the last frame will be an empty 
							sprite.</li><br>
					</ul>
                <li><span class="CYF"></span> <span class="term">sprite.animcomplete</span> - when an animation is played, that variable tells you if the 	
					animation is complete.<br>
					If no new animation has started yet, if the loop mode is <span class="term">LOOP</span> or if the animation isn't finished, this will be 
					false. Otherwise, it will be true.
                <li><span class="term">sprite.Set("new_sprite")</span> - change the sprite's image. It retains its scaling and rotation. If you
                    have an animation running with <span class="term">SetAnimation</span>, the animation will override your sprite change.
                </li><br>
                <li><span class="term">sprite.SetParent(other_sprite_object)</span> - parents <span class="term">sprite</span> to <span class="term">
				other_sprite_object</span>. This will make the original sprite move along with the object it's parented to.
                </li><br>
                <li><span class="term">sprite.SetPivot(x, y)</span> - changes the point the sprite rotates/scales around; (0,0) is bottom left of
                    sprite, (1,1) is top right. You can have values outside of the 0-1 range, too.
                </li><br>
                <li><span class="term">sprite.SetAnchor(x, y)</span> - change the point your sprite anchors to when moving. Mainly noticeable when
                    rescaling the parent sprite, and you want to have this sprite stick to a certain edge of it. x/y
                    should be in 0-1 range.
                </li><br>
                <li><span class="term">sprite.MoveTo(x, y)</span> - same as setting x and y simultaneously.</li><br>
                <li><span class="term">sprite.MoveToAbs(x, y)</span> - used to move a sprite to an absolute screen position, regardless of parent
                    settings. The sprite itself will remain parented.
                </li><br>
                <li><span class="term">sprite.Scale(xscale, yscale)</span> - same as setting xscale and yscale simultaneously</li><br>
                <li><span class="term">sprite.SetAnimation(sprite_table)</span> to do frame-by-frame animation at 30FPS. Example:
                    <span class="term">sprite.SetAnimation({"sans_head1", "sans_head2", "sans_head3"})</span>
					<br><span class="CYF"></span> In CYF, it can use sprites with different sizes!
                </li><br>
                <li><span class="term">sprite.SetAnimation(sprite_table, time_per_frame)</span> Performs frame-by-frame animation with your own time
                    between frames, in seconds. If <span class="term">time_per_frame</span> is 1, it takes 1 second to move to the next sprite.
					<br><span class="CYF"></span> Now it can use sprites with different sizes!
                </li><br>
                <li><span class="term">sprite.StopAnimation()</span> - stop the frame-by-frame animation if it was running. Also changes back to
                    the sprite it had before the animation, or whenever you last called <span class="term">sprite.Set()</span>.
                </li><br>
                <li><span class="term">sprite.SendToTop()</span> - sends this sprite to the top of its layer's hierarchy. If a sprite has 5
                    children, for instance, you can use this to rearrange them internally. However, child sprites will
                    always appear on top of their parents, regardless of this function being called.
                </li><br>
                <li><span class="term">sprite.SendToBottom()</span> sends this sprite to the bottom of its layer's hierarchy. Similar rules apply
                    as with <span class="term">SendToTop()</span>.
                </li><br>
                <li><span class="CYF"></span> <span class="term"> sprite.MoveBelow(other_sprite_object)</span> - if the two sprites have the same parent, 
					it'll move this sprite just below the other sprite.
                </li><br>
                <li><span class="CYF"></span> <span class="term"> sprite.MoveAbove(other_sprite_object)</span> - if the two sprites have the same parent, 
					it'll move this sprite just above the other sprite.
                </li><br>
                <li><span class="CYF"></span> <span class="term">sprite.Dust(playDust = true, removeObject = false)</span> - Turns a sprite into dust, just
					like what happens in Undertale when an enemy is killed. Will remove a bullet or sprite if <span class="term">removeObject</span> is set 
					to true. Set <span class="term">playSound</span> to false to deactivate the dust sound.
                </li><br>
                <li><span class="term">sprite.Remove()</span> - remove this sprite. Calling anything other than <span class="term">isactive</span> after 
					this will give you an error.
                </li><br>
