#Unitale - Lua moddable Undertale engine

Welcome to the Git repository for Unitale! In the coming week, a more detailed write-up about open sourcing will be done.

In the meantime, you'll want to load the ModSelect scene from the Scenes folder. In the Battle scene, a script is attached to the Main Camera for loading a mod immediately from within the scene.

##Required files

To be able to run Unitale you'll need the default Undertale assets. The default Undertale assets are by Toby Fox (http://www.undertale.com) and used with permission.
The files from this .zip should be unpacked to the Assets folder of the project.
